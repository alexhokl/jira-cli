// Details of a share permission for the filter.
type SharePermission struct {
	// The group that the filter is shared with. For a request, specify the `groupId` or `name` property for the group. As a group's name can change, use of `groupId` is recommended.
	Group *AllOfSharePermissionGroup `json:"group,omitempty"`
	// The unique identifier of the share permission.
	Id int64 `json:"id,omitempty"`
	// The project that the filter is shared with. This is similar to the project object returned by [Get project](#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-get) but it contains a subset of the properties, which are: `self`, `id`, `key`, `assigneeType`, `name`, `roles`, `avatarUrls`, `projectType`, `simplified`.   For a request, specify the `id` for the project.
	Project *AllOfSharePermissionProject `json:"project,omitempty"`
	// The project role that the filter is shared with.   For a request, specify the `id` for the role. You must also specify the `project` object and `id` for the project that the role is in.
	Role *AllOfSharePermissionRole `json:"role,omitempty"`
	// The type of share permission:   *  `user` Shared with a user.  *  `group` Shared with a group. If set in a request, then specify `sharePermission.group` as well.  *  `project` Shared with a project. If set in a request, then specify `sharePermission.project` as well.  *  `projectRole` Share with a project role in a project. This value is not returned in responses. It is used in requests, where it needs to be specify with `projectId` and `projectRoleId`.  *  `global` Shared globally. If set in a request, no other `sharePermission` properties need to be specified.  *  `loggedin` Shared with all logged-in users. Note: This value is set in a request by specifying `authenticated` as the `type`.  *  `project-unknown` Shared with a project that the user does not have access to. Cannot be set in a request.
	Type_ string `json:"type"`
	// The user account ID that the filter is shared with. For a request, specify the `accountId` property for the user.
	User *AllOfSharePermissionUser `json:"user,omitempty"`
