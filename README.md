# jira-cli

This is a CLI application managing JIRA.

### Setup

This application uses API keys to authenticate JIRA APIs. See references for how
to get a key.

The default configuration is stored at `\$HOME/.jira-cli.yml`. Once you obtained
an API key, configure property `email` and `api_key` like the following.

```yaml
email: some_user@testing.com
api_key: key_from_jira
```
